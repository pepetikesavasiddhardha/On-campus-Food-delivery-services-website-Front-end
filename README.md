#### In this project I have created a interactive website(front end) for Kanaka catering services avaliable in our campus with help of Html and CSS and hosted it on github.
#### In this website totally there are 4 sections along with Navigation bar. Home ,Services we provide , our clients and Contact form for each of them we use different    sections in html
#### Using CSS we have provided back ground images and styling of these 4 sections also done with help of it and also we made navbar sticky so that it will always remain on top of screen and we have provided smooth scrolling also
#### Phone.css file is used and basically commands for styling were given in this file if website is viewed from any sort of android or Iphones etc
