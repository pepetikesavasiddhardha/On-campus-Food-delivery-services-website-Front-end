#### In this project I have created a interactive website(front end) for Kanaka catering services avaliable in our campus with help of Html and CSS and hosted it on github.
#### In this website totally there are 4 sections along with Navigation bar. Home ,Services we provide , our clients and Contact form for each of them we use different    sections in html
#### Using CSS we have provided back ground images and styling of these 4 sections also done with help of it and also we made navbar sticky so that it will always remain on top of screen and we have provided smooth scrolling also
#### Phone.css file is used and basically commands for styling were given in this file if website is viewed from any sort of android or Iphones etc
#### Finally we hosted this website in github and above link can be used to view the website

#### some problems i faced while executing this project 
#### 1) css file should be named properly
#### 2) after mentioning anchor tag u should also link it with id or else it will not work
#### 3) all those are errors not warnings
#### 4) Putting z factor 100
#### 5) we can put send btn in middle by using center class 
#### 6) hosting first settings->github pages->main root and save->wait till link gets open
